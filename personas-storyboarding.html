          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            In order to practice crafting personas and building storyboards, I investigated the usability of a microwave found in my dorm's communal kitchen. I observed three different users
            interacting with the microwave. I also interviewed the users to gain
            insight into their experiences. Ultimately, I aim to identify the
            challenges users face when using the microwave and visualize their expriences through personas and storyboards.

            In summary, the microwave is located in a public, communal kitchen
            in a dormitory. The users interviewed are all college students
            residing in the building. The users had mixed feelings about the
            microwave. One user expressed that the microwave’s interface did not
            feel intuitive as a first-time user, especially compared to previous
            microwaves they had used before. They had pressed “Start” and
            expected the microwave to start for at least a minute, but instead
            nothing happened. When asked about how they resolve challenges, they
            all responded that if one button did not perform the expected
            action, they would press another. One user stated that the opening
            and closing of the microwave was intuitive, but setting time and
            power was less so. There was no mention of looking up information
            online or in a manual, which emphasizes one user’s point that they
            wished everything they needed to know was listed on the microwave,
            instead of having to guess.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            In conclusion, the microwave's interface is not intuitive for all
            users. The microwave has a number of different buttons and dials
            that can be confusing for first-time users. The lack of clear
            instructions on the microwave itself can lead to frustration and
            confusion. Additionally, there lacks an ordering to the different
            options, which can also be confusing to users. Users instead have to
            rely on trial and error to figure out how to use the microwave
            appropriately. Ultimately, this was a useful practice in building personas and storyboards to
            help visualize the challenges users face when using the
            microwave. These findings can be used to understand the needs and
            frustrations of users.
