          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            All design is iterative. Whether working within a group, for a
            customer, making a web interface, or a rocket engine, success
            necessitates openness to change and diverse perspectives. As part of
            Brown University's CSCI 1300: Interaction Design course, I worked
            with three classmates to design for Zest, a corporate gifting
            platform. Our task was to design a new interface for large-scale
            uploads of recipient information. From developing initial concepts
            within our group to showcasing our final mockup feature, we
            leveraged multiple opportunities for feedback and revision to create
            a more robust and polished feature. Here was our iterative process.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="input">
          <h2>The Problem Statement</h2>
          <p>
            We communicated directly with Christine Pun, Zest's lead UI Designer
            to establish a solid understanding of Zest's current problem.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Zest's current interface for CSV uploading was too restrictive,
            frustrating customers and limiting businesses' ability to customize
            their interface. We were tasked with creating an interface that
            could accommodate a diverse set of inputs while streamlining the
            whole process for the customer.

          <h2>Step 1: Initial Concepting</h2>
          <p>
            Once we had a clear idea of the problem we were trying to solve,
            each member of our team sketched out a series of screens
            representing four unique implementations of the feature. None of us
            communicated during this process, and we didn't look at Zest's
            current interface. The purpose of this step was to generate fresh
            ideas.
          </p>
          <h3>Concept #1:</h3>
          <div class="row">

          </div>

          <p>
            The first set of sketches represent four main steps. First, the user
            selects how they would like to enter the recipient info. After
            following the instructions to upload a CSV (should they choose that
            option), they are taken to a page which informs them of all required
            fields. If they choose to continue, a loading screen updates them on
            the status of their upload.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Key Features:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Presents the user with alternatives to CSV upload</li>
              <li>Option to download CSV template</li>
              <li>
                Provides clear instructions to the user at each step of the
                process
              </li>
              <li>Clear distinction between required and optional fields</li>
              <li>Visual updates keep the user engaged during down-time</li>
            </ul>

          <p>
            In the second set of sketches, three main steps comprise the
            feature:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              First, the user may choose to upload a CSV or add recipients
              manually.
            </li>
            <li>
              After uploading a CSV, they see the field mappings and can fix any
              errors that appear.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally they see a finalized recipients list after submitting.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <blockquote>

          <p>
            The third set of sketches follows a similar process as the second:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The first screen provides users with an area to upload their CSV.
            </li>
            <li>
              The second presents errors and an interface for interpreting and
              resolving them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Finally, they can see their original CSV displayed with no errors
              before submitting.

          </ol>
          <blockquote>

          <h2>Step 2: Combining Our Ideas</h2>
          <p>
            Once all four of us had come up with unique implementations of the
            feature, it was time to combine them into one unified wireframe. The
            purpose of this step was to take the best ideas from each of our
            concepts and build a prototype using them. Using four
            independently-created concepts allowed us to identify which features
            we had converged on, while also prompting us to investigate areas
            where our implementations differed. The result (shown below) was a
            prototype where each feature had been weighed against alternativesâ€”a
            much more robust first draft than any one of us could have created
            alone.
          </p>

          <h3 style="text-align: center">The Wireframe</h3>
          <img
            src="assets/zest_wireframe.png"
            alt="Zest Magic Spreadsheet Wireframe"
          />
          <br />

          <blockquote>
            In our finalized wireframe prototype, made using Balsamiq, the
            feature is broken up into three main screens. The first displays
            information about required fields and prompts the user to upload
            their CSV in the upload field. Once uploaded, the CSV is rendered
            in-window along with a visual representation of the field mappings
            and warnings about any major (column-wide) errors detected. This
            allows major errors to be fixed, and incorrect field mappings to be
            corrected, before moving on to finer-grained error handling. The
            final screen allows users to fix cell-specific errors before
            submitting their finalized list.
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            The wireframe combines features from all four of our initial
            concepts. Here are the features we kept from each:
          </p>

          <h3>Concept #1:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              List of required fields (helps reduce trial and error, clarifies
              the process without being restrictive)
            </li>
            <li>
              Large window for CSV uploading (showcases CSV functionality and
              makes it easy to drag files in)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Concept #2:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              CSV fully rendered in-window so user can see field mappings on
              their original import
            </li>
            <li>
              Error messages displayed to the side of each row (gives users
              explicit direction for fixing errors)
            </li>
            <li>
              Cells in rendered CSV are editable (reduces need to reupload, a
              major pain-point in the original)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Concept #3:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Top progress bar (keeps users informed/confident throughout the
              process)
            </li>
            <li>Red highlights on errors for enhanced visual communication</li>
            <li>
              Option to only view error rows (improves useability and
              accessibility by reducing visual clutter)
            </li>
            <li>
              Dropdowns for changing field mappings (gives users flexibility
              without necessitating complexity)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Concept #4:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Separate pages for viewing uploaded CSV and editing errors (clear
              flow reduces cognitive load)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>New features:</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Forward/backward navigation buttons at the bottom of each page
            </li>
            <li>
              Error fixing page collates user fields into required fields
              (clearer representation of what's required)
            </li>
            <li>Vertical and horizontal scrolling on spreadsheet displays</li>
          </ol>
        </section>

          <h2>Step 3: Initial Feedback</h2>
          <p>
            After completing our wireframe, we received feedback on it from a
            Teaching Assistant for our class. Below are some of the main points
            of feedback we received.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Page titles (in concert with progress bar) could help clarify the
              purpose of each page
            </li>
            <li>
              Adding a "reupload" button to the rendered-CSV page would
              eliminate redundant clicks
            </li>
            <li>
              Moving error messages from the side to a popup in each cell would
              make the UI more informative and fix formatting issues with
              multiple errors on one row
            </li>
            <li>Add back button to error-editing page for consistency</li>
            <li>Progress bar looked a too interactive/button like</li>
            <li>
              Add clarification to each item in the "required fields" list for
              more specificity
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Having a novice user look over our prototype webpage was invaluable
            for discovering where our feature was unclear or lacking
            functionality. It gave us a clear direction for the next phase of
            our work: creating a more polished mockup of our feature.

          <h2>Step 4: High-Fi Prototype</h2>
          <p>
            We developed our final prototype using Figma, which allowed us to
            model the interactions we expected users to perform. The combination
            of feedback and enhanced modeling enabled us to anticipate the pros
            and cons of each choice more accurately. Our final prototype closely
            resembles our original wireframe, incorporating several minor
            changes that enhance its functionality, usability, and
            accessibility.

              CSV (this allows the user to target erroneous cells correctly and
              with ease )
            </li>
            <li>
              Made the styling and messages of navigation buttons consistent
              across each page (this will clear some confusion as the user
              navigates from page to page)
            </li>
            <li>
              Made our progress bar look less like a button and more like a
              timeline (this will allow the user to understand where they are in
              the workflow without confusion)
            </li>
            <li>
              Added a confirmation and celebration page to our workflow (this
              will guide the user through the last steps of uploading their CSV)

          <h2>Final Feedback</h2>
          <p>
            Once we had completed our hi-fi prototype, we sent it to Zest for a
            final round of retrospective feedback. Below are some of the key
            comments and takeaways from our meeting and the overall process.
          </p>

          <h3>Feedback from Christine</h3>
          <blockquote
            style="
              background-color: rgba(224, 184, 239, 0.098);
              border-left: 5px solid #9925f2;

            <ol>
              <li>
                Christine appreciated the features we included to make our
                interface easier to use. These included the toggle for error row
                visibility, the progress bar at the top, the editable cells in
                our rendered CSVs, and the information popups we included.
              </li>
              <li>
                Christine felt that our interface could benefit from giving more
                explicit feedback to users throughout the process. For example,
                on the mapping page, we could have included more explicit
                messages about what users could do to edit the mappings or
                correct significant errors.
              </li>
              <li>
                There were some quality-of-life features that would have
                benefited our interface. Having error rows float to the top
                automatically, adding an option to save progress or download an
                in-progress CSV, and adding options to import other spreadsheet
                formats would have made the overall user experience smoother and
                more flexible.
              </li>
            </ol>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            Throughout working on this design for Zest, we have gone through
            numerous rounds of feedback and redesigning certain aspects of our
            CSV uploading and mapping features. Here are some key lessons
            learned throughout our workflow:

          <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              One strength was our streamlined interface that balanced
              simplicity with necessary guidance. With more time, we could have
              enhanced this with additional popup information and conditional
              feedback.
            </li>
            <li>
              While we received visual feedback, actual user testing would have
              been invaluable. Our limited resources reinforced the importance
              of all design stagesâ€”this initial mockup provides the foundation
              for future user testing.

              The project highlighted how various tools serve different
              development phases. Using Balsamiq for wireframing, Figma for
              detailed modeling, and Loom for sharing demonstrated how selecting
              appropriate tools for each stage improves efficiency and results.
